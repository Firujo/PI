A circle, is the geometric position of all the points whose distance from a central point is equal to some number "R".

You want to find the points whose distance is less than or equal to that "R", our radius.

The distance equation in 2d euclidean space is d(p1,p2) = root((p1.x-p2.x)^2 + (p1.y-p2.y)^2).

Check if the distance between your p and the center of the circle is less than the radius.

Let's say I have a circle with radius r and center at position (x0,y0) and a point (x1,y1) and I want to check if that point is in the circle or not.

I'd need to check if d((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) < r which translates to:

Math.sqrt((x1-x0)*(x1-x0) + (y1-y0)*(y1-y0)) < r

In JavaScript.

Now you know all these values (x0,y0) being bubble.x and bubble.y and (x1,y1) being x and y.
